  "description": "As an exotic dancer working in a strip club, Anora is encouraged to create an alter-ego, a construct that can appeal to the gendered expectations of the patrons who visit the strip club where she works. She creates Ani, a soft-spoken, coquettish femme who uses a practiced facade of submissiveness to coax dollars out of her patrons. The club has clearly delineated rules by which the performers and patrons must abide, for good reason as Anora comes to find out. ",
