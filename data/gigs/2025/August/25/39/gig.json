I’ll develop and run a multi-channel campaign (social teasers, creator partnerships, campus/community outreach, PR, and email) with clear conversion funnels to RSVPs. Expect a launch kit—messaging, assets, ad sets, landing copy—and weekly performance reports optimizing toward CPA, attendance rate, and post-event engagement.",
