  "pitch": "This conference isn’t just another gathering—it’s a cultural intervention against the creeping dominance of techno-feudalism. I’ll deliver a campaign that makes the event impossible to ignore: sharp messaging, bold visuals, targeted outreach, and thought-leadership content that builds credibility and urgency. The result? A packed room of engaged participants and an enduring digital footprint that keeps the critique alive long after the conference ends.",
