  "pitch": "I’ll craft and run a full event marketing campaign for “The Philosophy of Absolute Batman” that turns casual fans into ticket-holders. From sharp creative assets and targeted ads to campus and community outreach, I’ll build anticipation and keep RSVPs climbing. Expect a campaign that feels as bold and iconic as Batman himself—measured, optimized, and designed to pack the room.",
