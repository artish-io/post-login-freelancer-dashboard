  "pitch": "I can make this conference impossible to ignoreâ€”I understand the cultural and political stakes at play and know how to translate them into sharp messaging and bold campaigns. My approach will ensure the event resonates not only with academics but also with journalists, activists, and the wider public who care about democracy in the digital age. My goal is straightforward: deliver a packed house and build an enduring digital footprint that keeps the critique of techno-feudalism alive long after the conference ends.",
