  "summary": "I’d love to support your upcoming James Bond look-alike cosplay charity contest, especially since the proceeds will be donated to an orphanage in the form of $5,000 worth of 007 NFTs. My goal is to ensure full financial transparency, accurate recording of funds, and a clear audit trail for both participants and donors. By providing professional bookkeeping, I’ll help your team build trust, demonstrate accountability, and maximize the long-term impact of this charitable initiative.",
