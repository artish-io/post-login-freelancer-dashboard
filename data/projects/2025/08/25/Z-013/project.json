  "description": "Drive awareness and ticket sales for “The Philosophy of Absolute Batman”—a thought-provoking panel talk series blending pop culture with ethics, psychology, and design. I’ll develop and run a multi-channel campaign (social teasers, creator partnerships, campus/community outreach, PR, and email) with clear conversion funnels to RSVPs. Expect a launch kit—messaging, assets, ad sets, landing copy—and weekly performance reports optimizing toward CPA, attendance rate, and post-event engagement.",
