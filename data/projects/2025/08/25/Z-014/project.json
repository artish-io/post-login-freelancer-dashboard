  "description": "Drive visibility and engagement for a conference uniting thinkers, activists, and academics critiquing techno-feudalism—the consolidation of power by digital platforms and algorithmic systems. I’ll design and execute a multi-channel campaign (social, newsletters, media outreach, partnerships) to highlight the urgency of these conversations and attract the right audience. Attendees can expect a thought-provoking event positioned as both intellectually rigorous and culturally relevant.",
