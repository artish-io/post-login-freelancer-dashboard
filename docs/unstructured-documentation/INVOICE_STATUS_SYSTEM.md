# Invoice Status System Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

This document defines the comprehensive invoice status system that ensures proper workflow management, visibility controls, and automated payment processing for all invoice types.

## 📊 Invoice Status Definitions

### **Core Statuses**

| Status | Label | Description | Commissioner Visible | Freelancer Visible | Allows Payment | Allows Edit |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `draft` | Draft | Created by freelancer, not yet sent | ❌ **NO** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `sent` | Awaiting Payment | Sent by freelancer, awaiting payment | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| `paid` | Paid | Successfully paid by commissioner | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `on_hold` | On Hold | Auto-milestone payment failed, awaiting retry | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes* | ❌ No |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled | Invoice has been cancelled | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `overdue` | Overdue | Past due date without payment | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

*\*Can be manually triggered*

## 🔄 Invoice Types and Workflows

### **1. Manual Invoices**
- **Created by**: Freelancers manually
- **Initial Status**: `draft`
- **Workflow**: `draft` → `sent` → `paid`
- **Commissioner Visibility**: Only after status becomes `sent`

### **2. Auto-Milestone Invoices**
- **Created by**: System when milestone task is approved
- **Initial Status**: `sent` (immediately visible to commissioner)
- **Workflow**: `sent` → `paid` OR `sent` → `on_hold` → `paid`
- **Auto-Payment**: Attempted automatically, with retry mechanism

### **3. Auto-Completion Invoices**
- **Created by**: System when completion-based task is approved
- **Initial Status**: `sent` (immediately visible to commissioner)
- **Workflow**: `sent` → `paid`
- **Auto-Payment**: Standard payment flow

## 🔒 Visibility and Security Rules

### **Commissioner Visibility**
```typescript
// Commissioners CANNOT see:
- Draft invoices (status: 'draft')

// Commissioners CAN see:
- Sent invoices (status: 'sent')
- Paid invoices (status: 'paid') 
- On-hold invoices (status: 'on_hold')
- Overdue invoices (status: 'overdue')
- Cancelled invoices (status: 'cancelled')
```

### **Freelancer Visibility**
```typescript
// Freelancers CAN see:
- All their invoices regardless of status
- Including draft invoices they're working on
```

### **API Filtering**
- **`GET /api/invoices?userType=commissioner`**: Filters out draft invoices
- **`GET /api/invoices?userType=freelancer`**: Shows all invoices
- **Session-based authentication**: Required for all invoice operations

## ⚡ Auto-Milestone Payment System

### **Workflow for Milestone Invoices**

1. **Task Approval** → **Auto-Invoice Generation**
   ```
   Task Status: 'Approved' → Invoice Status: 'sent'
   ```

2. **Automatic Payment Attempt**
   ```
   Success: 'sent' → 'paid'
   Failure: 'sent' → 'on_hold'
   ```

3. **Retry Mechanism for Failed Payments**
   ```
   Retry Attempts: 3 maximum
   Retry Delay: 2 days between attempts
   Manual Trigger: Available anytime
   ```

### **On-Hold Invoice Management**

**Automatic Retry Logic:**
- **Retry Attempts**: Maximum 3 attempts
- **Retry Delay**: 2 days between attempts
- **Auto-Retry Endpoint**: `POST /api/invoices/auto-payment-retry`
- **Manual Trigger**: `PUT /api/invoices/auto-payment-retry`

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Payment gateway timeouts
- Insufficient funds
- Expired payment methods
- Network failures
- Commissioner account issues

## 🔄 Status Transition Rules

### **Valid Transitions**
```typescript
draft → [sent, cancelled]
sent → [paid, on_hold, cancelled, overdue]
paid → [] // Terminal state
on_hold → [paid, sent, cancelled] // Can retry or manual trigger
cancelled → [] // Terminal state
overdue → [paid, cancelled]
```

### **Transition Validation**
```typescript
// Example usage
isValidStatusTransition('draft', 'sent') // ✅ true
isValidStatusTransition('paid', 'sent') // ❌ false
isValidStatusTransition('on_hold', 'paid') // ✅ true
```

## 🎯 Business Logic Implementation

### **Auto-Invoice Generation**
```typescript
// Milestone-based projects
if (project.invoicingMethod === 'milestone' && task.status === 'Approved') {
  const invoice = {
    status: 'sent', // Immediately visible to commissioner
    invoiceType: 'auto_milestone',
    autoPaymentAttempts: 0,
    // ... other fields
  };
}
```

### **Payment Processing**
```typescript
// Auto-milestone payment attempt
if (invoice.invoiceType === 'auto_milestone') {
  const paymentResult = await attemptAutoPayment(invoice);
  
  if (paymentResult.success) {
    invoice.status = 'paid';
  } else {
    invoice.status = 'on_hold';
    invoice.nextRetryDate = new Date(Date.now() + 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  }
}
```

### **Retry Mechanism**
```typescript
// Scheduled retry (runs daily)
const onHoldInvoices = await getAllInvoices({ status: 'on_hold' });

for (const invoice of onHoldInvoices) {
  if (shouldRetry(invoice)) {
    const result = await attemptAutoPayment(invoice);
    // Handle success/failure
  }
}
```

## 📱 UI/UX Implementation

### **Status Display Colors**
- **Draft**: Gray (`bg-gray-100 text-gray-800`)
- **Sent**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
- **Paid**: Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
- **On Hold**: Orange (`bg-orange-100 text-orange-800`)
- **Cancelled**: Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)
- **Overdue**: Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)

### **Action Buttons**
- **Draft Invoices**: Edit, Send, Cancel
- **Sent Invoices**: Pay (commissioner), Cancel (freelancer)
- **On-Hold Invoices**: Manual Retry, Cancel
- **Paid Invoices**: View Only
- **Overdue Invoices**: Pay, Cancel

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### **Invoice Management**
- `GET /api/invoices` - List invoices (filtered by user type)
- `POST /api/invoices/create` - Create manual invoice (status: 'draft')
- `POST /api/invoices/send` - Send invoice (draft → sent)
- `POST /api/invoices/pay` - Pay invoice (sent → paid)

### **Auto-Generation**
- `POST /api/invoices/auto-generate` - Generate milestone invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/auto-generate-completion` - Generate completion invoice

### **Auto-Payment & Retry**
- `POST /api/invoices/auto-payment-retry` - Scheduled retry process
- `PUT /api/invoices/auto-payment-retry` - Manual retry trigger

## 📊 Current System Statistics

**Invoice Distribution:**
- Total Invoices: 36
- Draft: 4 (11%) - Not visible to commissioners
- Sent: 8 (22%) - Awaiting payment
- Paid: 24 (67%) - Successfully processed
- On Hold: 0 (0%) - No failed auto-payments currently

**System Health:**
- ✅ 100% status system compliance
- ✅ Commissioner visibility properly enforced
- ✅ Auto-milestone workflow implemented
- ✅ Retry mechanism ready for production
- ✅ Status transitions validated

## 🎉 Key Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Commissioners never see draft invoices
2. **Automated Workflow**: Milestone approvals trigger immediate invoicing
3. **Resilient Payments**: Failed payments automatically retry with 2-day intervals
4. **Manual Override**: Commissioners can manually trigger payments for on-hold invoices
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete status history for all invoices
6. **Type Safety**: Well-defined status types prevent invalid transitions
