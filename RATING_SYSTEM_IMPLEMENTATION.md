---

## 🔧 **Bug Fixes Applied**

### Issue 1: "Project must be completed to rate" Error
**Problem**: Rating system was checking `project.status === 'completed'` but projects in "Completed" tab use calculated completion based on task status.

**Solution**: ✅ Fixed
- Updated rating API to check task completion instead of project status
- Rating now works when all tasks have `status: "Approved"` and `completed: true`
- Removed redundant project status check

### Issue 2: Project Tracking Pages Missing Data
**Problem**: Project name and organization logo not displaying in project tracking pages.

**Solution**: ✅ Fixed
- Added missing `readAllProjects` import to `/api/dashboard/project-details`
- Project tracking pages now properly display project name and organization logo

### Issue 3: Empty Notes Modal
**Problem**: Notes modal showing empty popup.

**Solution**: ✅ Fixed
- Fixed the same API endpoint that provides notes data
- Notes modal now properly loads and displays project notes

### Issue 4: Profile Headers Showing Hardcoded Ratings
**Problem**: Profile header components were displaying hardcoded ratings instead of fetched ratings from the API.

**Solution**: ✅ Fixed
- Updated `components/user-profiles/profile-header.tsx` to fetch ratings from API
- Added rating fetching logic with proper loading states
- Replaced hardcoded star display with `ReadOnlyStars` component
- Shows "No ratings yet" when user has no ratings
- Displays rating count alongside average rating
