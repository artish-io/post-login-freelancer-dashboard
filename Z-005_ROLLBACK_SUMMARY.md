# Project Z-005 Rollback Summary

## 🎯 Issue Identified
Project Z-005 experienced a **premature final payment** where the system incorrectly paid the full 88% remaining budget ($2,904) when only 1 of 2 tasks was approved. This was exactly the bug we fixed in the completion project logic.

## 📊 Original State (Before Rollback)
- **Total Budget**: $3,300
- **Upfront Payment**: $396 (12% ✅ correct)
- **Premature Final Payment**: $2,904 (88% ❌ incorrect - should wait for all tasks)
- **Total Paid**: $3,300 (100% ❌ project not complete)
- **Task 1**: Approved ✅
- **Task 2**: Still Ongoing ❌

## 🔧 Rollback Actions Performed

### 1. **Cancelled Premature Invoice** ✅
- **File**: `data/invoices/2025/August/19/Z-005/TB-012.json`
- **Action**: Changed status from `"paid"` to `"cancelled"`
- **Reason**: Added cancellation reason for audit trail

### 2. **Updated Project Paid Amount** ✅
- **File**: `data/projects/2025/08/20/Z-005/project.json`
- **Action**: Reduced `paidToDate` from $2,904 to $396
- **Result**: Only upfront payment remains

### 3. **Cancelled Transaction** ✅
- **File**: `data/transactions/2025/08/20/TXN-PAY-TB-012-1755677329425/payment.json`
- **Action**: Changed status from `"completed"` to `"cancelled"`
- **Result**: Transaction marked as invalid

### 4. **Adjusted Freelancer Wallet** ✅
- **File**: `data/payments/wallets.json`
- **Action**: Reduced balance from $3,564 to $660 (removed $2,904)
- **Result**: Wallet reflects only legitimate earnings

### 5. **Prepared Task for Manual Invoice** ✅
- **File**: `data/project-tasks/2025/08/20/Z-005/1755677555674-task.json`
- **Action**: Added `manualInvoiceEligible: true` and `invoicePaid: false`
- **Result**: Task 1 ready for manual invoice testing

## 📋 Current State (After Rollback)

### Project Status ✅
- **Status**: `ongoing` (not completed)
- **Total Budget**: $3,300
- **Paid To Date**: $396 (only upfront)
- **Remaining Budget**: $2,904
- **Invoicing Method**: `completion`

### Task Status ✅
- **Task 1** (Phase 1: Love Is Weyland): `Approved` - Ready for manual invoice
- **Task 2** (Phase 2: Child Prodigies and Silence): `Ongoing` - Still in progress

### Invoice Status ✅
- **Upfront Invoice** (TB-007): `paid` - $396 ✅
- **Final Invoice** (TB-012): `cancelled` - $2,904 ✅

### Wallet Status ✅
- **Freelancer Balance**: $660 (corrected)
- **Lifetime Earnings**: $660 (accurate)

## 🧪 Manual Invoice Calculation (CORRECTED)

### Correct Logic ✅
With the proper completion project logic:
- **Total Budget**: $3,300
- **Upfront Payment**: $396 (12% commitment, NOT for any task)
- **Task Portion Budget**: $2,904 (88% for ALL tasks)
- **Total Tasks**: 2
- **Amount Per Task**: $2,904 ÷ 2 = **$1,452**

### Key Correction ✅
- **Upfront payment is NOT payment for a milestone/task**
- **It's simply a commitment payment to show good faith**
- **The 88% remaining budget is divided equally among ALL tasks**
- **Each task gets the same amount regardless of approval status**

### Testing Scenarios Available
1. **Manual Invoice Creation**: Task 1 can have a manual invoice created for $1,452
2. **Manual Payment**: The manual invoice can be paid
3. **Final Payment Trigger**: When Task 2 is approved, final payment should be $1,452 (for Task 2)
4. **Completion Gate**: System correctly blocks automatic final payment until all tasks approved

## 🚪 Completion Gate Verification ✅

Our new completion gate correctly identifies:
- **All Tasks Approved**: `false` (Task 2 still ongoing)
- **Has Remaining Budget**: `true` ($2,904 remaining)
- **Ready for Final Payout**: `false` ✅

**Result**: Final payment is correctly blocked until Task 2 is also approved.

## 🎯 Rollback Success Criteria ✅

- ✅ **No residual payment data** - All premature payments cancelled
- ✅ **Clean invoice state** - No conflicting invoices
- ✅ **Accurate wallet balance** - Freelancer wallet corrected
- ✅ **Proper task states** - Task 1 ready for manual invoice, Task 2 ongoing
- ✅ **Completion gate working** - Automatic final payment blocked
- ✅ **Manual invoice ready** - Edge case testing available

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Manual Invoice Creation**: Create manual invoice for Task 1 ($1,452)
2. **Test Manual Payment**: Pay the manual invoice
3. **Complete Task 2**: Approve the remaining task
4. **Verify Final Payment**: Ensure final payment is $1,452 (for Task 2 only)
5. **Validate Notifications**: Ensure all completion notifications fire correctly
